            <p>Hello My name is Nikoloz Kirkitadze. I am from Georgia. Beloved country in eastern europe, with great nature and food. But I think that's not the reason why you visited my portfolio page. The t=real reason is that you really want to know who I am. Well I guess i am gonna tell you that. I am 16 years old web programmer, who is currently studying an GOA(GOAL ORIENTED ACADEMY) and a guy who's willing to become something that no one can be in this life, I mean ,, THE BEST" you might be confused about what does the best bean, it's absolutely out of context, but it actually is not. The Best means, the best in everything that I do, to say id differently, Maximalist or Perfectionist. And to say it shortly, I jus want to be in my life The Best.
            </p>
